This project involved improving the production planning process during my internship, where I focused primarily on the SAP application for the CEE line. Throughout my work, I observed several minor issues and discovered that the assembly line lacked a proper weekly planning system. To address this gap, I took the initiative to create a weekly production planning system using Excel VBA. The aim was to streamline the planning process by factoring in workforce fluctuations and prioritizing production tasks based on time constraints, ultimately improving efficiency on the assembly line.
